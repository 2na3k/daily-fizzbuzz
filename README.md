# Everyday I do fizzbuzz in a different way

I do fizzbuzz with Python.

Fizzbuzz problem: Given an integer n, for every integer `i <= n`:
- print "Fizz" if the number is divisible by 3.
- print "Buzz" if the number is divisible by 5.
- print "FizzBuzz" if the number is divisible by both 3 and 5.

Hope I could pass 27 (days), and if it is not humorous, I failed.
